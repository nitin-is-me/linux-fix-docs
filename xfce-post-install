## Redshift (for eye protection)

1. Install redshift:
   ```
   sudo apt install redshift redshift-gtk
   ```
2. Make a config file named `redshift.conf`:
   ```
   ~/.config/redshift.conf
   ```
3. Paste this inside that file and save it:
   ```
    [redshift]
    temp-day=3500
    temp-night=3500
    brightness=1.0
    gamma=1.0
    transition=0
    location-provider=manual
    
    [manual]
    lat=0
    lon=0
   ```
4. Now start redshift either from start menu or by typing `redshift-gtk` in the terminal.
5. Click on the icon in panel to check if autostart is enabled or not.

## xfce4-clipman (for clipboard history)

1. Install xfce4-clipman
   ```
   sudo apt install xfce4-clipman
   ```
2. Start clipman either from start menu or by typing `clipman` in the terminal.
3. Click on the icon in panel to check if autostart is enabled or not.

## light-locker (in replacement of xfce4-screensaver for auto locking, nothing more)

1. Install light-locker
   ```
   sudo apt install light-locker
   ```
2. That's it, now it's available in the power manager of xfce. We can also download a separate software for managing its settings: `sudo apt install light-locker-settings`, but it's not needed in most cases.

## arc-theme and papirus-icon-theme (nice, dark, stable theme and icon that go well together)
 
1. Install arc-theme and papirus-icon-theme
   ```
   sudo apt install arc-theme papirus-icon-theme
   ```
2. Apply them both from appearance settings.
